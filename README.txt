PURPOSE OF PROJECT:

A system to help Librarians with day-to-day tasks such as returning books,
issuing books, and displaying library user and catalogue information.


REQUIREMENTS: 

Java 8
IntelliJ IDEA (with junit 4.12 to run tests)


INSTRUCTIONS:

IF RUNNING FROM LOOSE FILES:

	- put all files ending with 'Test' i.e. UserTest.java, 
	into a folder called 'test'
	- put the rest of the .java files into a folder called 'src'

To successfully test the program, you must have a file of library data
located at the following file path

	- C:\LibraryManagementSystem\librarydata.txt 

For messages to be successfully written out, the following file must also
exist

	- C:\LibraryManagementSystem\messages.txt

Search the LibraryIO class for references to these filepaths if you would
prefer to change them.

Open the folder with the 'test' and 'src' folders in it
with IntelliJ IDEA and run LibraryIO.main();


TO RUN THE TESTS:

- Make sure you have junit 4.12 installed.
- Mark the directory 'test' as the test sources root.
- Right click the folder and 'Run all tests'
